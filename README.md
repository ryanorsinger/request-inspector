HTTP Inspector
=================

HTTP Inspector is a quick way to test the contents of your requests.

Set your HTML form's attribute to "https://http-inspector.glitch.me" and send requests.

The output will show:
- The HTTP method type
- The HTTP body for showing key-value pairs in POST requests
- The query containing the key-value pairs contained in the GET request
